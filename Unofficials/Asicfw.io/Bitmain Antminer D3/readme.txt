Alternative firmware for Antminer D3
Free custom firmware will allow you to fully reveal all the possibilities of your miner!

The developers' fee is not more than ~1.8% of the total hash rate. And for large farms there are special conditions.

Improved energy efficiency, safe acceleration, fine tuning

 - Automated settings by consumption or performance profile;
 - Selection of the voltage and frequency for the payload automatically and manually;
 - Fine tuning of frequencies individually by chips, possibility to start in work faulty payments;
 - Built-in web interface Wattmeter, available via API;
 - Fan control, disabling fan control for immersion immersion cooling - no more cooler emulators needed;
 - Watchdog on temperature, chip loss, hash rate;
 - Parallel Dev fee mining, without stoppages and suspension of main mining;
 - Compatible with all control and monitoring systems, API;
 - We recommend that you start with a low or standart frequency - D3 is too gentle.
