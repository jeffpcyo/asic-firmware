Alternative firmware for Antminer T9 +
Free custom firmware allows you to fully discover all the possibilities of your miner!

Developers fee is no more than ~ 1.8% of the total hash rate. And there are special conditions for large farms.

 - Improving energy efficiency by 25% - t9+ up to 13.5T in air, 14-15T on immersion cooling;
 - Automated settings for consumption or performance profiles;
 - Selection of voltage and frequency per circuit board automatically and manually;
 - AsicBoost SHA256 on any pools supporting technology for T9+;
 - Fine tuning of frequencies per chip individually;
 - The Wattmeter built into the web interface, available via API;
 - Frequency is up to 1175Mhz, and it may be higher than 850Mhz but only for immersion cooling - up to 14+TH;
 - Fan control, fan control disconnection for immersion cooling – cooler emulators no longer needed;
 - Watchdog is performed by temperature and hash rate;
 - Parallel Dev fee mining, without drawdowns and suspension of the main mining process;
 - Compatible with all management and monitoring systems, API;
 - Automation for mass firmware for S9 ASIC series – patch generation (mini firmware with config) with all settings and mass update, support for auto-numbering adds to the worker of the 2nd octet of the IP address of ASIC (workername.0x23);
 - The ability to redirect a part of the device hash rate (1-20%) to pay for services for host hotels and managers - Redirect % of ASIC speed to additional pool (for example: rent payments, electricity and etc.).
